## Table Filter JavaScript Code
This JavaScript code enables table filtering on a webpage based on user input. It includes the following features:

updateFilters(): This function saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed.
filterTable(): This function filters the table data based on the changed element's id.
Event listener modification: The event listener is modified to detect a "change" on each input element and call the updateFilters() function.
Update with search criteria: The webpage is updated with the search criteria after the user presses "Enter".
These features provide a more interactive and user-friendly experience for website visitors. Simply follow the instructions in the code to implement these features on your webpage.
